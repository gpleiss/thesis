%In west Philadelphia born and raised on the playground was where I spent most of my days.
%Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool and all shootin some b-ball outside of the school,
%when a couple of guys who were up to no good started making trouble in my neighborhood.
%I got in one little fight and my mom got scared.
%She said ``You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air.''
%I begged and pleaded with her day after day but she packed my suit case and sent me on my way.
%She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
%I put my Walkman on and said, ``I might as well kick it.''
%First class, yo this is bad---drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
%Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
%Hmm this might be alright.
%But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that---is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
%I don't think so; I'll see when I get there.
%I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air.
%Well, the plane landed and when I came out there was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out.
%I ain't trying to get arrested yet.
%I just got here.
%I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared.
%I whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror.
%If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought ``Nah, forget it---Yo, homes to Bel Air.''
%I pulled up to the house about seven or eight, and I yelled to the cabbie, ``Yo homes smell ya later!''
%I looked at my kingdom; I was finally there to sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air.

\section{Applications}

In previous sections we showed, both theoretically and empirically, that msMINRES-CIQ accurately computes $\bK^{\pm1/2} \bb$ while scaling better than traditional (Cholesky-based) methods.
In this section we demonstrate applications of this increased speed and scalability.
In particular, we show that using CIQ in conjunction with variational Gaussian processes and Bayesian optimization facilitates higher-fidelity models that can be applied to large-scale problems.

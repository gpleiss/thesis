\section{Selecting Quadrature Locations and Weights}
Here we briefly describe the quadrature formula derived by \citet{hale2008computing} for use with Cauchy's integral formula.
We refer the reader to the original publication for more details.

Assume that $\bK$ is a positive semi-definite matrix, and thus has real non-negative eigenvalues.
Our goal is to approximate Cauchy's integral formula with a quadrature estimate:
%
\begin{align}
	f(\bK)
  &= \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint_\Gamma f(\tau) \left( \tau \bI - \bK \right)^{-1} \intd \tau
  \label{eqn:contour_integral_2}
  \\
  &\approx
  \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \sum_{q=1}^Q \widetilde w_q f(\tau_q) \left( \tau_q \bI - \bK \right)^{-1},
  \label{eqn:contour_integral_quad_2}
\end{align}
%
where $f(\cdot)$ is an arbitrary matrix function, and $\widetilde w_q$ and $\tau_q$ are quadrature weights and locations respectively.
Note that \cref{eqn:contour_integral_2} holds true for any contour $\Gamma$ in the complex plane that encompasses the spectrum of $\bK$.

\paragraph{A na\"ive approach with uniformly-spaced quadrature.}
For now, assume that $\lambda_\text{min}$ and $\lambda_\text{max}$---the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of $\bK$---are known.
(We will later address how they can be efficiently estimated.)
A na\"ive first approach to \cref{eqn:contour_integral_quad_2} is to uniformly place the quadrature locations in a circle that surrounds the eigenvalues:
%
\[
  \tau_q = \lambda_\text{min} + \frac 1 2 \left( \lambda_\text{max} - \lambda_\text{min} \right) \left( 1 + e^{2 i \pi \left( q / Q \right)} \right),
  \quad
  \widetilde w_q = \frac 1 Q.
\]
%
This corresponds to a standard midpoint quadrature rule.
However, \citet{hale2008computing} demonstrate that the convergence of this quadrature rule depends linearly on the condition number $\kappa(\bK) = \lambda_\text{max} / \lambda_\text{min}$.
As many kernel matrices tend to be approximately low-rank and therefore ill-conditioned, this simple quadrature rule would require a large $Q$ for numerical accuracy.

\paragraph{Improving convergence with a change of variables.}
Rather than uniformly spacing the quadrature points, it makes more sense to place more quadrature points near $\lambda_\text{min}$ and fewer near $\lambda_\text{max}$.
This can be accomplished by using the above midpoint quadrature rule in a \emph{transformed parameter space} that is ``stretched'' near $\lambda_\text{min}$ and contracted near $\lambda_\text{max}$.
In particular, we will use a change-of-variables that exploits the geometry of the square root function for rapid convergence.

\subsection{A Specific Quadrature Formula for $f(\bK) = \bK^{-1/2}$}
\citet{hale2008computing} suggest performing a change of variables that projects \cref{eqn:contour_integral_2} onto an annulus.
Uniformly spaced quadrature points inside the annulus will cluster near $\lambda_\text{min}$ when projected back into the complex plane.
This change of variables has a simple analytic formula involving Jacobi elliptic functions (see \citep[][Sec. 2]{hale2008computing} for details.)
In the special case of $f(\bK) = \bK^{-1/2}$, we can utilize an additional change of variables for an even more efficient quadrature formulation \citep[][Sec. 4]{hale2008computing}.
Setting $\sigma = \tau^{1/2}$, we have
%
\begin{align}
	\bK^{-\frac 1 2}
  &= \frac{1}{\pi i} \oint_{\Gamma_s} \left( \sigma^2 \bI - \bK \right)^{-1} \intd \sigma.
  \nonumber
  \\
  &\approx
  \frac{1}{\pi i} \sum_{q=1}^Q \widetilde w_q \left( \sigma_q^2 \bI - \bK \right)^{-1},
  \label{eqn:contour_integral_quad_3}
\end{align}
%
where $\Gamma_\sigma$ is a contour that surrounds the spectrum of $\bK^{1/2}$.
Since the integrand is symmetric with respect to the real axis, we only need to consider the imaginary portion of $\Gamma_\sigma$.
Consequentially, all the $\tau_q$ quadrature locations (back in the original space) will be real-valued and negative.
Combining this square-root change-of-variables with the annulus change-of-variables results in the following quadrature weights/locations:
%
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \sigma_q^2
    &= \lambda_\text{min}^{-1} \Bigl( \text{sn}(i u_q \mathcal{K}'(k) \mid k) \Bigr)^2,
    \\
    \widetilde w_q
    &= -\frac{ 2 }{ \pi Q \sqrt{\lambda_\text{min}} }
    \:\: \left[
    \mathcal{K}'( k )
    \:\:\: \text{cn} \left( i u_q \mathcal{K}'(k) \mid k \right)
    \:\:\: \text{dn} \left( i u_q \mathcal{K}'(k) \mid k \right)
    \right],
  \end{split}
  \label{eqn:quad_points_and_locations}
\end{equation}
%
where we adopt the following notation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $k = \sqrt{ \lambda_\text{min} / \lambda_\text{max} } = \sqrt{ \kappa(\bK^{-1}) }$;
  \item $\mathcal{K}'(k)$ is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind with respect to the complimentary elliptic modulus $\sqrt{1 - k^2}$;
  \item $u_q = \frac{1}{Q}(q - \frac 1 2)$; and
  \item $\text{sn}(\cdot \mid k)$, $\text{cn}(\cdot \mid k )$, and $\text{dn}(\cdot \mid k)$ are the Jacobi elliptic functions with respect to elliptic modulus $k$.
\end{itemize}
%
The weights $\widetilde w_q$ and locations $\sigma_q^2$ from \cref{eqn:quad_points_and_locations} happen to be real-valued and negative.
Setting $t_q = -\sigma_q^2$ and $w_q = -\widetilde w_q$ gives us:
%
\begin{equation}
	\bK^{-\frac 1 2} \approx \sum_{q=1}^Q w_q \left( t_q \bI + \bK \right)^{-1}, \quad w_q = -\widetilde w_q > 0, \quad t_q = -\sigma_q^2 > 0.
  \label{eqn:contour_integral_quad_4}
\end{equation}
%
Note that the shifted matrices $(t_q \bI + \bK)$ are all positive definite.

\paragraph{Convergence of the quadrature approximation.}
Due to the double change-of-variables, the convergence of this quadrature in \cref{eqn:quad_points_and_locations} is extremely rapid---even for ill-conditioned matrices.
\citeauthor{hale2008computing} prove the following error bound:
%
\begin{lemma}[\citet{hale2008computing}, Thm. 4.1]
  Let $t_1$, $\ldots$, $t_Q > 0$ and $w_1$, $\ldots$, $w_Q > 0$ be the locations and weights of \citeauthor{hale2008computing}'s quadrature procedure (see \cref{app:quadrature}).
  The error of \cref{eqn:contour_integral_quad} is bounded by:
  \[
    \left\Vert \bK \sum_{q=1}^Q w_q \left( t_q \bI + \bK \right)^{-1} - \bK^{\frac 1 2} \right\Vert_2
    \leq \bigo{\exp\left( -\frac  {2 Q \pi^2}{\log \kappa(\bK) + 3} \right)},
  \]
  where $\kappa(\bK) = \lambda_\text{max} / \lambda_\text{min}$ is the condition number of $\bK$.
\label{lemma:hale}
\end{lemma}
%
\noindent
Remarkably, the error of \cref{eqn:contour_integral_quad} is \emph{logarithmically} dependent on the conditioning of $\bK$.
Consequentially, $Q\approx10$ quadrature points is even sufficient for ill-conditioned matrices (e.g. $\kappa(\bK) \approx 10^4$).

\subsection{Estimating the Minimum and Maximum Eigenvalues}
The equations for the quadrature weights/locations requires on knowing the extreme eigenvalues $\lambda_\text{max}$ and $\lambda_\text{min}$.
Using the Lanczos algorithm (\cref{sec:lanczos}), we can obtain accurate estimates of these extreme eigenvalues through $\approx 10$ matrix-vector multiplies with $\bK$.
Recall that the Lanczos algorithm forms the relation $\bQ^\top_J \bK \bQ_J = \bT_J$, where $\bQ_J$ is orthonormal and $\bT_J$ is tridiagonal.
To estimate $\lambda_\text{min}$ and $\lambda_\text{max}$ from Lanczos, we perform an eigendecomposition of $\bT_J$.
If $J$ is small (i.e. $J \approx 10$) then this eigendecomposition will require minimal computational resources.
A well-known convergence result of the Lanczos algorithm is that the extreme eigenvalues of $\bT_J$ tend to converge rapidly to $\lambda_\text{min}$ and $\lambda_\text{max}$ of $\bK$ \citep[e.g.][]{saad2003iterative,golub2012matrix}.


\subsection{The Complete Quadrature Algorithm}
\cref{alg:quadrature} obtains the quadrature weights $w_q$ and locations $t_q$ corresponding to \cref{eqn:quad_points_and_locations,eqn:contour_integral_quad_4}.
Computing these weights requires $\approx 10$ matrix-vector multiplies with $\bK$---corresponding to the Lanczos iterations---for a total time complexity of $\bigo{N}$.
All computations involving elliptic integrals can be readily computed using routines available in e.g. the SciPy library.
